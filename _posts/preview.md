title: "What I want to learn"
excerpt: "As I try to get my bachelor's degree in computer science I want to take most of my learning and put it into game designing or game development. I mainly want to focus on these two subject when it comes to computer science I always wanted to create video games not matter how long it takes me to make it. I will always be proud of my work."

## Learning

I want to gain as much as possible while being in a 4 year computer science degree. Even I want to go for a 8 year degree if I am confident and think I can do it. But for now I want to see how far I can go when it comes to game developing or game designing. For right now this is my passion. I can't wait what the next 3 years will teach me about computer science.
