title: "Dynamic Routing and Static Generation"
excerpt: "Game designing is my passion and I always wanted to do it as a kid. There is also game developing but I like game designing more. I always watch videos or look at people make video games. My favorite kind of game designing are 2-D games or pixelated video games."
